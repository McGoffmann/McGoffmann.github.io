                    set out in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement, allows a GATT member to take a “safeguard” action to
                    protect a specific domestic industry from an unforeseen increase of imports of any product which is
                    causing, or which is likely to cause, serious injury to the industry. The agreement stipulates that
                    a member shall not seek, take or maintain any voluntary export restraints, orderly marketing
                    arrangements or any other similar measures on the export or the import side. The agreement further
                    sets out requirements for safeguard investigation which include public notice for hearings and other
                    appropriate means for interested parties to present evidence, including on whether a measure would
                    be in the public interest. The agreement sets out the criteria for “serious injury” and the factors
                    which must be considered in determining the impact of imports. The safeguard measure should be
                    applied only to the extent necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate
                    adjustment. Where quantitative restrictions are imposed, they normally should not reduce the
                    quantities of imports below the annual average for the last three representative years for which
                    statistics are available, unless clear justification is given that a different level is necessary to
